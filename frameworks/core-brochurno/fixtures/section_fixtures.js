It\'s probably going to be in a pretty consistent state of flux for a while as I iron more out and as I use it for my own other projects. Any and all help would be pretty cool. You can get everything on <a href='https://github.com/sevifives/Brochurno'>github</a>.</p><p>Following a stabilization, I plan to build an admin section that will hook into CoreBrochurno so it'll be even easier to administer a CoreBrochurno-based app. But it's all fed by data, so you don\'t have to wait.</p>",

Here are some tips, methods, paradigms, and other solutions might be found. If you happen to know of any, I\'d be happy to add them in and give any credit where it is due.</p>"
